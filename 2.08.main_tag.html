<!these different tags which we saw like header,footer,main,section,aside etc, work the same but they have different understanding from computer's aspect, which you will study much later, but these tags are also able to take any image, link, text etc>
<!In other words, these tags are only useful for SEO(Search Engine Optimization)>
<!And they need the CSS for doing their real work>
